Created by the [Visualisation group](https://visualization.group/), which is part of the Centre for Artifical Intelligence in Public Health Research (ZKI-PH) of the Robert Koch-Institute.

## Dependencies
The code is written in Python 3.11.12 with the following libraries installed:

|Library|Version|
|---|---|
|biopython|1.78|

## Data
The example datasets which are used to predict the Post Translational Modifications are collected from the [UniProt Database](https://www.uniprot.org/) with the filter (reviewed:true) to obtain only experimentally verified proteins.

## Code
|Script|Description|
|---|---|
|[code/](./code/)|contains all scripts used for dataset modification.|
|[code/remove-common-seqs.py](./code/remove-common-seqs.py)|contains the code for filtering oout false negatives.|
|[code/generator-x-balanced.py](./code/generator-x-balanced.py)|contains the code to generate a balanced classes.txt and seqs.fasta for two given FASTA files.|
