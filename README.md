Created by the [Visualisation group](https://visualization.group/), which is part of the Centre for Artifical Intelligence in Public Health Research (ZKI-PH) of the Robert Koch-Institute. This repository was developed as part of a bachelor thesis.

## Dependencies
The code is written in Python 3.11.13 with the following libraries installed:

|Library|Version|
|---|---|
|biopython|1.85|
|bs4|4.13.4|
|cd-hit|4.8.1|
|joblib|1.5.1|
|NumPy7|2.3.0|
|matplotlib|3.10.2|
|pandas|2.3.0|
|requests|2.32.4|
|scikit-learn|1.7.0|
|venn|0.1.3|
|wandb|0.21.0|

## Data
The protein sequences used to predict the Post Translational Modifications are collected from seven different databases.
- SwissProt
- NCBI
- dbPTM
- ptmd
- PTMCode2
- qPTM
- Unipep

These databases were integrated, filtered, and processed into positive and negative datasets for machine learning classification. Preprocessing steps included merging, deduplication, false negative removal, clustering, and sequence-length filtering. Full details are described in the thesis.

## Code
### The repository is organized into two main directories:

|Script|Description|
|---|---|
|[data_preprocess/](./data_preprocess/)|Scripts for retrieving, cleaning, and preparing the datasets.|
|[data_preprocess/data_pipeline.py](./data_preprocess/data_pipeline.py)|Orchestrates the entire preprocessing workflow: merging, deduplication, filtering, clustering, and length cutoff. Produces final positive/negative multi-FASTA files and labels.|
|[data_preprocess/download_all.py](./data_preprocess/download_all.py)|Downloads protein sequences in FASTA format from all databases.|
|[data_preprocess/merge.py](./data_preprocess/merge.py)|Merges multi-FASTA files from multiple databases into unified PTM-specific files, ensuring consistency and removing duplicates.|
|[data_preprocess/disease.py](./data_preprocess/class_generator.py)|Extracts disease associations from UniProt annotations and links them to protein sequences.|
|[data_preprocess/negatives.py](./data_preprocess/negatives.py)|Generates negative datasets by filtering out sequences that contain the PTM of interest while allowing other PTMs.|
|[data_preprocess/cluster.py](./data_preprocess/cluster.py)|Runs CD-HIT to cluster sequences at 40% similarity, retaining one representative per cluster to reduce redundancy and avoid data leakage.|
|[data_preprocess/class_generator.py](./data_preprocess/class_generator.py)|Generates the classes.txt label file and a consolidated seqs.fasta containing both positive and negative sequences for machine learning input.|
|[data_preprocess/venn_diagrams.py](./data_preprocess/venn_diagrams.py)|General visualization script; generates Venn diagrams of sequence overlaps across PTMs and diseases.|
|[data_preprocess/stacked.py](./data_preprocess/stacked.py)|Creates stacked bar plots showing the distribution of 8 main PTMs in UniProt over time.|

|Script|Description|
|---|---|
|[rfc/](./rfc/)|Scripts related to feature encoding and classification with Random Forests.|
|[rfc/encoding_pipeline.py](./rfc/encoding_pipeline.py)|Converts sequences into machine learning features via iCAN for Random Forest training.|
|[rfc/rfc_with_cv.py](./rfc/rfc_with_cv.py)|Trains and evaluates the Random Forest classifier with cross-validation. Reports performance metrics.|
